# Trade-backtesting
To test if the scrip is profitable or not at a given day. 
The CSV read is obtained from a third party scanner which contains stocks for 9 months which were selected through various filters.
These stocks are for the next day Long/short purpose.
The scanner itself can be implemented on my own. But for time being a 3rd party scanner is used.
